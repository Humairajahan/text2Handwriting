# text2Handwriting

This project is converting any text to your handwriting using numpy and some convolutions mostly. For better result, fill out the Handwriting Form and then scan it using a scanner. If the image is distorted, the algorithm might not work properly. Fill out the form as you would like it. Then fill out the alphabet.txt file according to that progression of characters. The code will take the demo.txt file as input to be written and convert that into your own handwriting.
