Monday
Mom's always saying that friends will come and go but family is forever. Well, if that's true, I could be in for a rough ride.
I mean, I love my family and all, but I'm just not sure we were meant to LIVE together. Maybe it'll be better later on when we're all in different houses and only see each other on holidays, but right now things are just a little dicey.
I'm surprised Mom's always Pushing the 'family' message, since she thinks if she and her sisters don't really get along. Maybe she thinks if she keeps repeating it to me and my brothers, then we'll come out different. But, if I was her, I wouldn't hold my breath.
I think Mom is just trying to make me feel better about my situation with Rowley anyway. Rowley's been my best friend ever since he moved into my neighbourhood, but things have been really changed between us recently. 
And it's all because of a GIRL.
Believe me, the last person in the world I ever thought would get a girlfriend was ROWLEY.
I always thought I'D be the one in a relationship and Rowley would be the guy everyone kind of felt sorry for. 
I guess I've got to give Rowley some credit for actually finding a girl who likes him. But I don't have to be HAPPY about it.
Back in the good old days, it was just me and Rowley, and we hung out and did whatever we wanted. If we felt like blowing bubbles in our chocolate milk at lunch, then that's exactly what we did.
But now that there's a girl in the picture things are TOTALLY different.
